Title: Data Scientist Rouskin Lab

Classification: Exempt: Research staff

Reports to: Silvi Rouskin, Principal Investigator

Research background and goals

RNA is unique among all biomolecules as it can be both information-storing and enzymatic. These features are tightly linked to its structure, in which base-pairing interactions give rise to a highly folded macromolecule. Indeed, in addition to the genetic code, which specifies the composition of proteins, we now know there is a secondary layer of information encoded in every transcript in the form of RNA structure that can regulate processes as diverse as splicing, localization, and translation efficiency. Recent genome-wide association and biochemical studies have linked multiple diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, to changes in RNA structure. The Rouskin lab is focused on developing new methodologies to identify and quantify multiple RNA conformations and to use this methodology to answer fundamental and unresolved questions on pre-mRNA structures that control alternative splicing.

Overall responsibility

Collaborate on short- and long-term independent scientific projects to support the research objectives of the lab. Utilize programming skills to design and develop computational tools for biological data analyses. Analyze experimental data and address methodological problems in results. Use discretion in prioritizing and organizing workflow and in optimizing methodologies and results.

About LogRocket

LogRocket was founded in 2016 by Matthew Arbesfeld and Ben Edelstein, a computer science duo who have been building products together since the 3rd grade. Frustrated by how difficult it was to understand their customers' experiences, Arbesfeld and Edelstein set out towards an audacious goal: make every experience on the web as perfect as possible.

Our team is a diverse group who bring an eclectic set of experiences from Google, Meteor, Drift, HubSpot, MIT and Columbia. We enjoy lunch together every day in our airy downtown Boston office, learning more about each other at our Show and Tells, and hosting our friends during #logrocketeer events. We focus on building our software with care and craftsmanship -- our engineering blog posts give you a taste of that -- and we welcome talented people from all backgrounds. Many of us have important spaces in our lives -- whether it be family, social organizations, schools, or former companies -- and we're doing all we can to make LogRocket another one.

LogRocket is an equal opportunity employer.

As a result, The Broad Institute has created a machine learning initiative to drive innovation beginning with the world's leading killer, cardiovascular disease. We are building open-source software to derive insights from massive amounts of multimodal clinical and genomic (ECGs, MRIs, EHRs) data using deep learning architectures. Our aims include more than just predictive accuracy for the onset of disease -- we will use our models to uncover new biology itself that can drive new therapeutics and treatment.

The role:

You will work on a small team of machine learning scientists, engineers and cardiovascular disease experts.

You will identify the highest impact opportunities by whiteboarding solutions with the top genetic and clinical researchers in the world.

You will conduct theoretical ML research with collaborators from MIT and Harvard and implement cutting edge methods for learning representations of cardiovascular health.

You will collaborate regularly with MD/PhDs from across the life sciences to explore how to embed cardiac physiology into learning agents.

You will hunt for new ways to accelerate therapeutic development with industry collaborators.

You will deploy cloud-based software to a diverse audience of researchers across the world.

You will work with real patient genomic and clinical data to train and validate impact.

Basically, we’ve taken all the guesswork out of the weather.

We’re different than all other weather providers out there that repackage the same data and models. That’s because we see everything around us as a possible weather sensor, from wireless networks to connected cars. We call this approach Weather-Of-Things. And with so many of our sensors out there, we went ahead and built a proprietary big data collection and analysis platform, combined with exclusive AI-driven weather models. Around the office, this is known as the MicroWeather Technology Engine.

We’re also proud to bring hyper-accurate weather information and enhanced access to critical weather-related data to the entire world. Our technology can potentially save and transform billions of lives - mainly in developing countries.

Our weather forecasts are trusted by top companies such as JetBlue, Via, United, Ford, AWS, and many more industry trendsetters.
